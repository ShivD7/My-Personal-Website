            <p>
              I am currently a high-school student attending Centennial C.V.I in Guelph, Ontario. I like to develop games, apps, websites, and many other projects that can prove useful to everyone! My favourite sports include tennis, basketball, soccer, and badminton. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, as well as spending time with my friends. I hope to have a successful career in the IT world!
